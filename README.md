# Chingu Developers Network Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chingu-x/chingu-client.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/chingu-x/chingu-client)

The client for our GraphQL API. The project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so any
rules of the generator will apply to this project as well.

## Instructions to run locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Modify the GraphQL URI in (/src/index.js)[/src/index.js].
3. Start the server `$ npm start`.

## Building
